In this project, the main objective was to enhance my knowledge in JavaScript. The challenge was to build the project based on the model from the Frontend Mentor platform, getting as close as possible to it. The first phase of the project was to build the HTML and CSS structure, and in this first step, some important concepts were applied.

In HTML, Flexbox was used for better alignment of the elements, the creation of a toggle to include the JavaScript logic, and in CSS, the styling of the entire page.

The second phase was to apply the JavaScript logic, thus making the page interactive with the user.
